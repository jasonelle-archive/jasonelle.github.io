      <title>Will Apple forbid Cordova, React Native, Native Script and similar technologies?</title>

      <description>If you want your app to be inside the iOS ecosystem it must pass the Appstore Review Guidelines. Apple is known to be strict when approving apps. Since Cordova, React Native, Native Script and similars use Javascript, the sections 4.7 and 2.5.2 of the Appstore Review Guidelines and section 3.3.2 of the Apple Developer Program License Agreement are the most relevant to this use case.
Appstore Review Guidelines - &amp;lsquo;2.</description>

      <description>Jasonette Beginnings Jasonette was born in early 2016 and made it&amp;rsquo;s public debut in October 2016.
These are the technical hightlights that Ethan defined for Jasonette.
Features  App loads over HTTP: Your app exists 100% as JSON, and loads from the cloud. No more hard-coding. An app in 30 minutes: No kidding, build an app in 30 minutes. Lowest possible learning curve: No programming experience required. There&amp;rsquo;s only one thing you need to know: JSON.</description>

      <description>On November 6th it will be a whole year since the beginning of this humble project. We made a lot of changes, bug fixes and some new features to the Jasonette code base since Ethan left.
Expect a new release near the second week of November 2019. This will be stored in the https://github.com/jasonelle/jasonelle repository, in the releases tab.
Future plans? After learning the inner workings of the Jasonette code base and a lot of feedback made in the community we discovered that many issues could be solved by simplifyng the code base.</description>

      <description>Today marks one year after Ethan left the digital world.
Ethan was a tremendous human being, someone you can trust and have a good conversation of about any topic.
We really want to think that he took a super long vacation and someday will return. We maintain the hopes high.
This is similar to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_Godot tragicomedy.
In this day we want to highlight a tweet he wrote in response to this question.</description>

      <title>Cell.js No Longer Maintained</title>
      <link>/blog/cell-js-is-deprecated/</link>

      <description>Cell.js was an amazing web framework created by Ethan. It&amp;rsquo;s main goal was to simplify web development using JSON like structures.
Jasonelle Team decided that no longer will invest time in Cell.js development.
The main reason is the following:
 Jasonelle will be about Mobile App Development. Web development will not be the focus for Jasonelle.
 A framework to be succesfully be adopted, needs a huge amount of work, examples and documentation.</description>

      <title>Jasonette 2 development will begin</title>
      <link>/blog/jasonette-2/</link>

      <guid>/blog/jasonette-2/</guid>
      <description>The current version of Jasonette (Android and iOS) will stop to be futher maintained with bug fixes or new features. The reason is that all the time and energy will be focused on a new version of Jasonette.
Objectives  Backward compatible with Jasonette 1. So you don&amp;rsquo;t have to learn anything new. Modular Code. So it&amp;rsquo;s easier to understands what&amp;rsquo;s going on behind scenes.  iOS The first platform to be supported will be iOS since it&amp;rsquo;s the platform that Jasonelle team have better expertise.</description>

      <description>Well today I dedicated the entire day working on a new version of JasonBase, since the old one is dead.
You can access and use it now in https://base.jasonelle.com
And of course see the code at https://github.com/jasonelle/jasonbase

      <title>Jason App Is Not Working</title>

      <description>As we previously said jasonbase.com is down and many projects that depends on it may not be working.
One of such projects is Jason App. Thankfully we could obtain the json before jasonbase.com&amp;rsquo;s death.
In order to keep using Jason App you should compile a new Jasonette project and direct to the file here
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonelle/docs/develop/examples/jasonette/apps/jason-app/index.json
If you correctly compile you should now have a working copy of the Jason App</description>

      <title>Jasonbase Is Down</title>
      <link>/blog/jasonbase-is-down/</link>

      <guid>/blog/jasonbase-is-down/</guid>
      <description>As some of you may have noticed if you visit jasonbase.com, you will encounter a 500 error.
This was expected since we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any access to the server or the domain configuration.
This means that other pages may dissapear as well like jasonette.com, celljs.org. Since we cannot pay for the servers to continue running.
Alternatives Jasonbase&amp;rsquo;s focus was to make easier to share JSON files, mainly used for Jasonette projects.</description>

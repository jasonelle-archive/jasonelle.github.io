      <description>Well today I dedicated the entire day working on a new version of JasonBase, since the old one is dead.
You can access and use it now in https://base.jasonelle.com
And of course see the code at https://github.com/jasonelle/jasonbase
Main Differences This is a list of differences.
   Old New     Private Source Code Available in Github   Made in Ruby on Rails Made with PHP and ProcessWire   User and Password No User-Password only Private Link   Full code editor Just a simple Textarea   Only Json supported in input Json and HJson Supported in input   Output non minimized Minimized output   Intended for Production Intended for Testing and Quick Sharing   Made by Ethan Made by CLSource    The focus on the new Jasonbase is only on the code sharing part.</description>

      <description>As we previously said jasonbase.com is down and many projects that depends on it may not be working.
One of such projects is Jason App. Thankfully we could obtain the json before jasonbase.com&amp;rsquo;s death.
In order to keep using Jason App you should compile a new Jasonette project and direct to the file here
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonelle/docs/develop/examples/jasonette/apps/jason-app/index.json
If you correctly compile you should now have a working copy of the Jason App</description>

      <title>Jasonbase Is Down</title>

      <description>As some of you may have noticed if you visit jasonbase.com, you will encounter a 500 error.
This was expected since we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any access to the server or the domain configuration.
This means that other pages may dissapear as well like jasonette.com, celljs.org. Since we cannot pay for the servers to continue running.
Alternatives Jasonbase&amp;rsquo;s focus was to make easier to share JSON files, mainly used for Jasonette projects.</description>

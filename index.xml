      <description>As we previously said jasonbase.com is down and many projects that depends on it may not be working.
One of such projects is Jason App. Thankfully we could obtain the json before jasonbase.com&amp;rsquo;s death.
In order to keep using Jason App you should compile a new Jasonette project and direct to the file here
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonelle/docs/develop/examples/jasonette/apps/jason-app/index.json
If you correctly compile you should now have a working copy of the Jason App</description>

      <description>As some of you may have noticed if you visit jasonbase.com, you will encounter a 500 error.
This was expected since we didn&amp;rsquo;t have any access to the server or the domain configuration.
This means that other pages may dissapear as well like jasonette.com, celljs.org. Since we cannot pay for the servers to continue running.
Alternatives Jasonbase&amp;rsquo;s focus was to make easier to share JSON files, mainly used for Jasonette projects.</description>

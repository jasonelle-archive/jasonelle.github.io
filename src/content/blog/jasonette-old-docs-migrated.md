In order to future proof *http://docs.jasonette.com/* we migrated the
latest build of those docs to [https://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/](https://jasonelle.com/jasonette-old-docs/).

It was a complete copy with no modifications. So maybe some links could die.

Expect better docs in [https://jasonelle.com/docs/](https://jasonelle.com/docs/).

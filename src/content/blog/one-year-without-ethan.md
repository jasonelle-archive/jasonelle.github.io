Today marks one year after Ethan left
the digital world.

Ethan was a tremendous human being, 
someone you can trust and have a good conversation of about any topic.

We really want to think that he took
a super long vacation and someday will
return. We maintain the hopes high.

This is similar to the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_Godot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waiting_for_Godot) tragicomedy.

In this day we want to highlight a tweet
he wrote in response to this question.

That really struck a chord with us. We know the value of money
and that is needed in order to buy food and pay the bills.

But we also want to follow Ethan's vision for *Jasonette*. A world
were **Anyone** should be able to build apps.

Currently we are only dedicating our spare time to the project. If we really
want to dedicate more time we have to come up with some way to pay the bills.
Some way that is compatible with Ethan's vision.

In the meantime we will keep working and having an amazing time in this
project.


To finish this blog post, we think enough time have passed to mark *June 9* as a milestone named **Ethan's day**. To remember the wonderful person that left, but someday could return.

*Cell.js* was an amazing web framework created by *Ethan*. It's main goal was
to simplify web development using *JSON* like structures.

*Jasonelle Team* decided that no longer will invest time in *Cell.js*
development.

The main reason is the following:

> Jasonelle will be about Mobile App Development. 
> Web development will not be the focus for *Jasonelle*.

A framework to be succesfully be adopted, needs a huge amount of
work, examples and documentation. And we want to focus on *Jasonette*
and related tools.

If you want to pick *Cell.js* as a maintainer, we happily will give you our
blessings and support your efforts. 

Other components like *ST.js* will continue to be maintained because
they are fundamental parts of *Jasonette* engine.

If you want some recommendation to replace cell.js we like [https://mithril.js.org/](https://mithril.js.org/index.html).

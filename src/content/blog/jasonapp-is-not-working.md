As we previously said [jasonbase.com is down](/blog/jasonbase-is-down) and many projects that depends on it may not be working.

One of such projects is [Jason App](https://github.com/jasonelle/docs/tree/develop/examples/jasonette/apps/jason-app). Thankfully we could obtain the json
before *jasonbase.com*'s death.

In order to keep using *Jason App* you should compile a new *Jasonette* project and direct to the file here 

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasonelle/docs/develop/examples/jasonette/apps/jason-app/index.json`


If you correctly compile you should now have a working copy of the *Jason App*

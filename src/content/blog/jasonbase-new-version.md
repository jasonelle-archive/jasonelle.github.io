Well today I dedicated the entire day
working on a new version of *JasonBase*, 
since the old one is dead.

You can access and use it now in
[https://base.jasonelle.com](https://base.jasonelle.com)

And of course see the code at
[https://github.com/jasonelle/jasonbase](https://github.com/jasonelle/jasonbase)

## Main Differences

This is a list of differences. 

|Old|New|
|---|---|
|Private Source| Code Available in Github|
|Made in Ruby on Rails| Made with PHP and ProcessWire|
|User and Password|No User-Password only Private Link|
|Full code editor|Just a simple Textarea|
|Only Json supported in input| Json and HJson Supported in input|
|Output non minimized| Minimized output|
|Intended for Production|Intended for Testing and Quick Sharing|
|Made by Ethan| Made by CLSource|


The focus on the new *Jasonbase* is only on the code sharing part. 
No fancy code editor and web administration. Just copy and paste the 
code you want to share and that's it.

There are plenty of good choices in code editors much better tailored for
use in programming.

**Save your Links** in a secure place, there are no way to recover them
if you forgot your public or private links.

## Where to host

*Jasonbase* is intented for **testing only**. So do not rely on it for use
in production level applications (apps that consumers will use in real life).

For that kind of use cases you can use more mature and battle tested
services like [Neocities.org](http://neocities.org) or a custom vps
server in *Digital Ocean* or your favourite web hosting.

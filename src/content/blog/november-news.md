Hello folks, it's been a while since the last blog post.
I will keep this short.

I have been struggling with many difficulties in the last 12 months,
specially in the finances. Mostly due to the worldwide pandemic and social
events in Chile. I couldn't land a proper job with stable income. I know
that i'm not the only one in this dire situation and I hope others can
find good health and economic stability soon.

After two years of maintaining this project I feel no more enjoyment
in doing so. It was quite a good ride with lots of ups and downs,
and meeting wonderful people in the community. But good things
comes to an end.

I have to step aside, for emotional and financial reasons.
Focus on finding something different to _Software Engineering_ for putting food on the table.
Since this career path didn't work out for me.

I want to keep this as professional as possible.
So to be a good maintainer I will release a final version with the latest
bug fixes on iOS and Android.

After that the sole maintainer would be
https://github.com/panterozo
https://t.me/Panterozo

until a new maintainer is found. Please talk to him
if you would like to take the mantle.

That's all for now.

Thanks again for the wonderfull memories :D

The current version of *Jasonette* (Android and iOS) will stop to be
futher maintained with bug fixes or new features. The reason is that
all the time and energy will be focused on a new version of *Jasonette*.

## Objectives

- Backward compatible with *Jasonette 1*. So you don't have to learn anything new.
- Modular Code. So it's easier to understands what's going on behind scenes.


## iOS

The first platform to be supported will be *iOS* since it's the platform that
*Jasonelle* team have better expertise. Once the *iOS* version is complete
an *Android* version could start to be programmed.

## New Tools

New tools are planned to be created alonside the new version. Like *Jay* a tool
for compiling *JSX* to *Json*. and *Jazz*, a Jasonette JSON linter.

See [Roadmap](/roadmap) for futher details.

## Final Thoughs

This is a new chapter in the history of *Jasonette* and *Ethan*'s legacy. We
want to improve on it's efforts and bring you awesome tools to unleash all
your creativity in Mobile App Development.
